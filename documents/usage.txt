The purpose of this CLI is to keep track of job applications.
It's proprietary technology is "Searching for applied jobs."
Indeed is best for finding jobs to apply for, but it's too slow 
when a prospective recruiter is on the line.

For those cases, you need to search for the company and job description fast - that is what this is for.

Let's be honest, most software developers are in a terminal when their phone rings anyway.
Now with a few skeystrokes, you can find the company information and job description
through the bulk of applications you sent out - just save a few aliases for this and
run the command anywhere: to see how, skip to the end of this document.

Let's start with the tedious stuff - how to add a job and company.
To add a company, you need to first save any information you have about the company in a file.
     after that execute main.py with the following flags
     -company <Company Name>
     -company_file <path to file with a description of the company>
     -home_page <link to the company's homepage>
     -business_type <what kind of business it is>
     -found <what resource you used to find the company>

     If any of the information is unknown, simply add "" at the end of the flag
